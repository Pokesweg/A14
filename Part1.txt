Cookies are implemented within websites to keep track of information that is collected by what the user does. It doesnâ€™t actually store personal information like passwords or usernames, but collects information from what the user actually searches and uses that as a preference to display things such as personalized advertisements. Cookies have both good and bad uses. For example, cookies are used in a good way where they improve the website's usability and personalize ads that could help you out. In a bad way, cookies make it easier to collect personal data like preferences in users and cookies hold smaller amounts of information (no more than 4kb). I do believe that the use of cookies is ethical because they help the website run more efficiently and is completely optional. It is possible to turn off cookies on your browser and you are able to deny its use therefore it gives a choice on whether the user prefers to have it incorporated into their website experience or not.
